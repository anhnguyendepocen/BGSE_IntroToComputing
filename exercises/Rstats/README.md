# Exercise

Folder content:
- linearmodels.Rmd 
- README.md


## Motivation

In this exercise you will get further practice in programming with R - in particular with defining the functions and defining statistical models. We will generate an artificial data using the function from one of the previous exercises and create a function for fitting linear models.

You will do this exercise by using Rmarkdown, a format developed by Rstudio developers which facilitates reproducibility a lot. 


## Instructions 

In all files you will find more detailed comments and instructions, spots where you are expected to do something and insert some code will be marked as: YOUR-CODE. Recall to save your changes with the git version control system, after you are done with a chunk of code.

1. Complete the file `linearmodels.Rmd`. 
2. Complete the file `gradientdescnet.Rmd`.
