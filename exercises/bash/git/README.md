# Exercise

Folder content:
- README.md


## Motivation

There are no scripts to write in this exeercise. Instead, you will get some practice with version control, using the code you have written in previous exercise. Most of the commands you will need you can find in the bash handout, but feel free to use any resource on the Internet, I'm sure there are many better tutorials out there. 


## Instructions 

1. Initialize version control in the `scripting` folder  
2. Add all the files and commit them to version control  
3. Create a new branch for a new feature of your code  
4. Switch to the the new branch  
5. Introduce some changes in the code, e.g. add a new stock that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange to the LIST variable  
6 Add and commit the changes  
7. Switch back to the master branch and continue working on it, introducing some changes (perhaps correcting the code if it didn't work) and committing them  
8. Merge the new feature branch from 3rd step into the master branch  
9. Revert the state of the repository to the state before the 3rd step   

**Extra:**
10. Create a repo at github (and an account if you don't have it)  
11. Associate your local `scripting` git repo with the newly created GitHub repo  
12. Push all of your commits to the GitHub repo  
13. Add a colleague next you as a collaborator on your GitHub project, she or he should do the same. Then introduce the changes in your colleagues repo and commit them.  

**Extra extra**
14. Fork the course repo at https://github.com/hstojic/BGSE_IntroToComputing  
15. Clone your new repo to work on it locally  
16. Create a new branch, switch to it 
17. Make some correction in the files, e.g. I'm sure I have a lot of grammar errors :), and commit changes from your branch to the origin 
18. Go to GitHub and make a Pull request to me to incorporate your changes in the main repository
